# Agro

A portal for all the farmers in India that aims to help them.
Since the advent of technology farmers in India have had little to no help from this field.
We intend to change that and hence, we created this portal which :-
1. Gives accurate and meaningful Weather information
2. Warnings related to weather and epidemics/pests
3. Pest detection using State of the art ML model and image recognition
4. Crop Predictions for their particular soil type and climatic conditions
5. Maximise Revenue
6. Forums for discussions with experts in Agriculture
7. End Resource Planning Model to sell the crops at the correct price in markets
8. News tailored to them, so that they are up to date with all the policies
9. Multi-lingual support for farmers with little exposure to English or Hindi
10. Basic Feature phone Support as well for those who don't have a smartphone and Internet Connection
